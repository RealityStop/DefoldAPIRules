The time-step is modified by a scaling factor and can be incremented either continuously or in discrete steps. The continuous mode can be used for slow-motion or fast-forward effects. The discrete mode is only useful when scaling the time-step to pass slower than real time (factor is below 1). The time-step will then be set to 0 for as many frames as the scaling demands and then take on the full real-time-step for one frame, to simulate pulses. E.g. if factor is set to 0.1 the time-step would be 0 for 9 frames, then be 1/60 for one frame, 0 for 9 frames, and so on. The result in practice is that the game looks like it's updated at a much lower frequency than 60 Hz, which can be useful for debugging when each frame needs to be inspected.\n    /// </summary>\n    /// <param name=\"factor\"></param>\n    /// <param name=\"mode\"></param>\n    public void SetTimeStep(double factor, TimeStepMode mode)\n    {\n        var message = new set_time_step_message() { factor = factor, mode = (dynamic)mode };\n        Message.postMessage(this, message);\n    }"
